# Redis on Rails example

This is an example rails application using redis as a cache based on [this tutorial](https://www.driftingruby.com/episodes/redis-basics)

## How to run

1. Ensure that redis is installed and running. I used `brew install redis` on MacOS
2. Run `rails server` to start the server
3. Run `redis-cli monitor` to start monitoring redis
4. Navigate to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and hit refresh to see redis in action.
